# Reflection

## What is reflection?

Reflection is the ability of a program to inspect its variables and values at run time and find their type. 

## What is the need to inspect a variable and find its type?

The first question anyone gets when learning about reflection is why do we even need to inspect a variable and find its type at runtime when each and every variable in our program is defined by us and we know its type at compile time itself. 

## Should reflection be used?

* Reflection is a very powerful and advanced concept in Go and it should be used with care. It is very difficult to write clear and maintainable code using reflection. It should be avoided wherever possible and should be used only when absolutely necessary.
