## What is Golang

Go also known as Golang is an open source, compiled and statically typed programming language created by google.

## Why Golang

Here are some of the pros which I found in choosing Go

* Concurrency is an inherent part of the language. As a result writing multithreaded programs is a piece of cake. This is achieved by Goroutines and channels which we will discuss later in the upcoming tutorials.
* Golang is a compiled language. The source code is compiled to native binary. This is missing in interpreted languages such as JavaScript used in nodejs.
* The language spec is pretty simple. The entire spec fits in a page and you can even use it to write your own compiler :)
* The go compiler supports static linking. All the go code can be statically linked into one big fat binary and it can be deployed in cloud servers easily without worrying about dependencies.
